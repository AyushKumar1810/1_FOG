Battlefield 4 SERVER INFO Page
Project Screenshot(Add a screenshot of your project here once deployed)

Project Overview
This project involves building the Battlefield 4 SERVER INFO page using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The design and assets are based on the Figma UI provided in the "#menu multiplayer / server browser / server info" frame. The page includes hover and click interactions, and the data highlighted in the green section is served from the backend via API calls.

Features
Frontend:

Responsive UI designed using React.js.
Reusable components for Server Info, Player List, and Map Details.
Hover and click interactions implemented using React state and event handlers.
Data fetched from the backend and displayed dynamically.
Backend:

Node.js server with Express.js for handling API requests.
API endpoints for serving server info, player list, and map details.
Mock data used for initial development.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

React.js
CSS or CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components)
Axios or Fetch API for data fetching
Backend:

Node.js
Express.js
JSON for data structure
Deployment:

Frontend: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
Backend: Heroku, Vercel, or Render
