Task - Build the Battlefield 4 SERVER INFO page. You can find the design and all assets on “#menu multiplayer / server browser / server info” frame of this Figma UI. Data highlighted in the green section should be served from the backend using one/multiple API calls. Hover and click interactions should work just as they do on the page.

Tips - Consider using free hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Make sure to test the page on different devices to ensure responsiveness.

To build the Battlefield 4 SERVER INFO page using React.js and Node.js, follow these high-level steps:

Setup the Project:

Initialize a new React project using Create React App.
Set up a Node.js backend using Express.
Design the Frontend:

Use the Figma design to create the UI components in React.
Break down the UI into reusable components (e.g., ServerInfo, PlayerList, ServerDetails).
Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library for styling to match the Figma design.
Implement hover and click interactions using React state and event handlers.
Setup the Backend:

Create an Express server.
Define API endpoints to serve the data required by the frontend.
Use mock data or connect to a real database if available.
Connect Frontend and Backend:

Use Axios or Fetch API to call the backend APIs from the React components.
Manage the data fetching and state in React using hooks like useState and useEffect.
Testing and Deployment:

Test the application on different devices to ensure responsiveness.
Deploy the frontend using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
Deploy the backend using a service like Heroku or Vercel.
Detailed Steps:
